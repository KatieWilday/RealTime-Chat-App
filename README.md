# Motivation
This project was my first fullstack application. At the time I was using Discord often, and was genuinely curious how difficult a barebones version would be to create. Which eventually led me down the path of Firebase. The setup/config of the "serverless" approach Firebase has taken was extremely easy to use. Considering at the time of building this app I had minimal backend/database experience. Overall, I am happy with how it turned out.


## Stack
JavaScript, React, SCSS, & Firebase/Firestore.
